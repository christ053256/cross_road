# CROSS ROAD
In Cross Road, players navigate a busy street filled with vehicles. The objective is to avoid getting hit by oncoming traffic as you try to cross the road. Successfully reaching the other side will allow you to advance to the next level. Be carefulâ€”if you get hit, you'll have to start over from the beginning! Feel free to let me know if you need any more adjustments!
