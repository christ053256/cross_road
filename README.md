### **The Adventure:**

Rimuru oozed onto the asphalt, the glossy surface reflecting the blinking pedestrian light ahead. **“Alright,”** Rimuru thought, **“let’s do this!”** It squished forward, dodging a scooter with a daring **“W.”** The rumble of a bus made Rimuru hesitate, but a quick tap of **“Space”** had it bouncing out of harm’s way.

Just as Rimuru approached the halfway point, a delivery drone dropped a package in its path. **“Of course,”** it groaned, sidling left with an **“A”** to avoid the obstacle. Spotting an opening in traffic, Rimuru activated its teleport with **“Q”**—a flash of blue light carried it three tiles forward, landing squarely in a safe zone.

The final stretch was chaos incarnate. Cars sped by, a dog chased its owner across the street, and a food cart toppled, spilling hotdogs everywhere. Rimuru steeled itself, **dodging left, jumping forward, teleporting, and narrowly escaping disaster** at every turn.

Finally, with one last leap, Rimuru squelched onto the other side of the road. The score tallied up: **100 points!** Rimuru sighed in relief and looked ahead. A lush meadow beckoned, promising tranquility after a harrowing journey.
